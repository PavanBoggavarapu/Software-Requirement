# Software-Requirement
A machine learning-based NLP project to classify GitHub text data like commit messages or README content using TF-IDF and traditional classifiers. Built with Python and Jupyter Notebook.
# GitHub Text Classification Using NLP
This project focuses on classifying GitHub-related text data‚Äîsuch as README content or commit messages‚Äîusing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The objective is to automatically assign categories to text entries, aiding in better organization, automation, and understanding of software repositories.
## üìå Features
- Text preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Machine Learning models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook
## üßæ File Overview
- `Git Text Classification.ipynb`: Core notebook containing the full pipeline‚Äîdata preprocessing, model training, evaluation
- (Optional folders: `data/`, `models/`, etc. if dataset or models are added)
## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- matplotlib (optional)
